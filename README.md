# RAG with Reranker

Welcome to the **RAG with Reranker** repository! In this project, we explore how to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by incorporating a reranker. Rerankers play a crucial role in refining search results obtained during the initial retrieval process. By evaluating and reordering candidates, rerankers improve the relevance and accuracy of answers generated by RAG models.

## Key Concepts

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: RAG combines retrieval-based methods with large language models (LLMs) to generate contextually relevant answers. It bridges the gap between information retrieval and natural language generation.
- **Reranker**: A reranker evaluates and reorders search results or passages to enhance their relevance to a specific query. In RAG, rerankers improve search quality by determining semantic relevance between documents and queries.
- **Types of Rerankers**:
  - **Score-based Rerankers**: Efficiently aggregate and reorder candidate lists based on scores or relative positions.
  - **Neural Network-based Rerankers (Cross-Encoder Rerankers)**: Leverage neural networks to compute similarity scores between queries and documents, ensuring semantic relatedness.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   - Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
